# IP Address Counter

Counts unique IPv4 addresses in text files. Works like `sort -u | wc -l ip_addresses.txt` but optimized for performance and memory usage.

## Installation

```bash
go install github.com/sdfsdhgjkbmnmxc/ip-counter-go/cmd/ip-counter@latest
```

## Usage

```bash
# Default (Auto - automatic strategy selection)
ip-counter ip_addresses.txt

# Specify method explicitly
ip-counter -method=Map ip_addresses.txt
ip-counter -method=Bitmap ip_addresses.txt
ip-counter -method=ParallelBitmap ip_addresses.txt
```

### Available Methods

Use `-method` flag to select implementation:

- **Naive**: String-based map without IP parsing (research/comparison)
- **Map**: Hash map, memory-efficient for smaller datasets (< 28M addresses, see `internal/u32/u32_test.go:TestMemoryCrossover`)
- **Bitmap**: Sequential bitmap, fixed 512 MB memory
- **ParallelBitmap**: Parallel bitmap with atomic operations, 3x faster than sequential Bitmap
- **Auto** (default): Automatically selects between Map and ParallelBitmap based on file size

## Optimizations

For maximum performance:

- **Memory-mapped I/O**: Reads files via `mmap` instead of standard I/O (stdin not supported)
- **Custom IPv4 parser**: Specialized parser converts addresses to `uint32`, significantly faster than standard library
- **Parallel processing with atomic operations**: Lock-free bitmap updates using CAS on uint64. Each worker maintains local counters to avoid contention, achieving near-linear scaling
- **Simple input format**: Expects valid IPv4 addresses, one per line (`\n` separated)

Attempted optimizations that didn't deliver:

- **Roaring bitmap** with various segment sizes: Added complexity without performance gains. For randomly distributed IPs, created too many small segments with excessive allocations, making it slower than simple bitmap. Simple strategy switching (map â†’ bitmap based on dataset size) proved more effective
- **Bitmap element size** (uint8 vs uint32 vs uint64): No measurable difference between implementations
